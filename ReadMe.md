## Usage

A command-line application that accepts user input. You are prompted for information about your application repository then a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
You can enter your project title then this is displayed as the title of the README.
You can enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
IF you choose a license for your application from the list of options then a badge for that license is added to the top of the README which is a clickable link to all the information about that license. When you enter your GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled GITHUB, with a link to your GitHub profile. When you enter your email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled EMAIL.
Ive included clickable links on the table of contents so if you are viewing the README and click on the links in the Table of Contents you will be taken to the corresponding section of the README.
